**About Me:** 

Everyday, we wake up to our morning routine whether that be a morning cup of coffee, reading the daily news, or driving to work. From coffee machines and e-readers, to cars and global-positioning systems, its easy to see the incredible impact technology has had on these daily tasks.

Business and entrepreneurship drives our creativity. Computer science gives us the tools to express it!!

As a junior in University of Waterloo's Computer Science and Business Administration Double Degree program, I am excited to explore the world of computer science to develop innovative solutions to some of the world's most pressing issues.
