                  including Angular 7/11, TypeScript, NodeJS, MongoDB, SQL, GraphQL, Jenkins, & ElasticSearch. MyGPS is an investing tool that investment consultants use to show real-time data
                  visualizations of a client's finances including projections, financial history, and overall portfolio.
                  I also had the opportunity to participate in RBC Battlesnake where I created a snake using TypeScript with A-star algorithm logic to compete in an RBC Battlesnake tournament!
                  
                  Furthermore, I joined the RBC StudentPartners team to coordinate events, opportunities and experiences for RBC students.

                  Finally, I had the chance to be an advocate for students with a 10K Coffees ideation workshop. I presented in a Student Partners x 10K Coffees Team Ideation workshop."
